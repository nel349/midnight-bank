# Bank UI Implementation Plan

## Implementation Status: **Phase 2 COMPLETE** âœ…

## Tech choices âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- UI: React + Vite + MUI âœ…
- Data/state: Direct RxJS observables (TanStack Query deferred)
- RxJS interop: Direct subscription to `bankAPI.state$` observables
- Local persistence: localStorage-based account storage âœ…
- Logging: pino (env-controlled) âœ…

## Local persistence âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- accounts: contract_address (unique), label?, created_at, last_used_at âœ…
- sessions: PIN authentication with 10-minute timeout âœ…
- Auto-touch account on access âœ…

## Routes âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- `/accounts`: welcome + list saved accounts (local) âœ…
- `/accounts/create`: create account (deploy + create in one step) âœ…  
- `/account/:contract`: account view with balance and actions âœ…

## Shared providers âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- `BankWalletProvider`: Lace wallet integration + auto-connect âœ…
- `DeployedAccountProvider`: deploy/subscribe management âœ…

---

## âœ… Phase 1: Onboarding COMPLETED

### Goals âœ… ACHIEVED
1) Connect Lace; set network id from config âœ…
2) Create account (deploy + create_account + verify) in one click âœ…
3) Persist account (address/label/timestamps) locally âœ…
4) Navigate to `/account/:contract` âœ…

### Deliverables âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- Local repo: accounts/sessions via localStorage âœ…
- `DeployedAccountProvider` for deploy/subscribe âœ…
- Pages: `AccountsHome.tsx`, `Onboarding.tsx` âœ…
- Connect Lace button; network id init âœ…
- Copy bank keys into dist on build âœ…

### Data flow âœ… WORKING
- Direct RxJS subscriptions to `bankAPI.state$` âœ…
- State updates via private state provider manual sync âœ…
- Real-time balance and transaction updates âœ…

### Acceptance âœ… VERIFIED
- Connect â†’ create (deploy+create+verify) â†’ navigate works end-to-end âœ…
- Account visible in `/accounts` list (local) âœ…
- PIN entered inline; session-based authentication âœ…

---

## âœ… Phase 2: Account view & actions COMPLETED

### Implemented Features âœ…
- **Masked balance panel**: Shows `***` by default for privacy âœ…
- **"Show Balance" authentication**: Runs `authenticateBalanceAccess` with PIN âœ…
- **Auto re-mask**: Balance hides after 10-minute timeout âœ…
- **Actions**: deposit/withdraw/verify buttons implemented âœ…
- **Real-time updates**: Direct `state$` subscription âœ…
- **Proper formatting**: Balance displays as currency (e.g., "50.00") âœ…

### Key Technical Achievement âœ…
- **Fixed private state persistence**: Manual state sync after circuit execution
- **Contract address consistency**: Uses contract address as private state key
- **Battleship pattern**: Applied working private state management pattern

## ðŸš§ Phase 3: Advanced Privacy Features (PLANNED)

### 3.1 Inter-Contract Transfers ðŸ†•
- **Send money to contract**: Transfer funds to another Midnight Bank contract
- **Recipient verification**: Validate target contract before transfer
- **Transfer privacy**: Amount and recipient remain confidential
- **Transfer authorization**: PIN-based confirmation for outgoing transfers

### 3.2 Selective Balance Disclosure ðŸ†•  
- **Custom disclosure permissions**: Grant specific contracts limited access
- **Threshold verification**: Yes/No disclosure for minimum balance requirements
- **Exact amount disclosure**: Full balance reveal to authorized contracts
- **Time-limited access**: Disclosure permissions with expiration
- **Revocable permissions**: Account holder can revoke access anytime

### Implementation Strategy:
- New circuits: `send_to_contract`, `create_disclosure_permission`, `verify_balance_threshold`
- Permission management in private state
- UI for managing disclosure permissions and inter-contract transfers

## ðŸš§ Phase 4: History views (FUTURE)
- Transaction history display from `transactionHistoryHex$` + `transactionCount`
- Detailed client-side history with filters/totals
- CSV/JSON export functionality
- Transaction details and timestamps

## ðŸš§ Phase 5: Backup/restore (FUTURE) 
- Encrypt-and-export private state
- Import flow for account recovery
- Cross-device synchronization

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

### Private State Management
- **Critical lesson**: Circuit witness calls don't automatically persist to private state provider
- **Solution**: Manual sync using `privateStateProvider.set()` + `privateStates$.next()`
- **Key insight**: Use contract address (not accountId) as consistent private state key

### Current Architecture  
- Direct RxJS observables (no TanStack Query)
- Manual private state synchronization after circuit transactions
- Session-based authentication with timeouts
- localStorage for account persistence

---

## ðŸš€ Future Optimizations

### Reduce Wallet Approvals
- Pre-deploy contracts to eliminate deployment transaction
- Combine `create_account` + `verify_account_status` into single circuit
- Single-transaction onboarding experience

### Enhanced UX
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Loading states and progress indicators  
- Offline support and state persistence
- Account backup/restore workflows
