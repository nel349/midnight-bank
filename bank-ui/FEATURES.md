## âœ… 4. Zelle-like Authorization System (Phase 3.1) - COMPLETED âœ…

### 4.1 Encrypted Balance Sharing âœ…
- [x] **Privacy-preserving balances**: Individual balances encrypted with user PINs
- [x] **Authorized transfer verification**: Recipients can verify sender balance without seeing amount
- [x] **Shared encryption keys**: Authorization-specific keys for balance verification
- [x] **Lazy balance updates**: Efficient updates only when authorization is used
- [x] **Zero-knowledge balance proofs**: Balance verification without disclosure

### 4.2 Authorization Workflow âœ…
- [x] **Request authorization**: Ask contacts to authorize you for transfers
- [x] **Approve requests**: Set maximum transfer limits for authorized users
- [x] **Instant transfers**: Send money to pre-authorized contacts without approval
- [x] **Bidirectional authorizations**: Both users can send to each other
- [x] **Multiple authorization support**: Authorize transfers with many contacts

### 4.3 Encrypted Token Claims âœ…
- [x] **Encrypted transfer amounts**: Transfer amounts hidden until claimed
- [x] **Pending claim detection**: Recipients detect transfers without seeing amounts
- [x] **Claim with PIN**: Zero-knowledge proof of ownership when claiming
- [x] **Multiple pending claims**: Support claims from different senders
- [x] **Accumulated transfers**: Multiple sends before single claim

### 4.4 Selective Balance Disclosure (FUTURE)
- [ ] **Permission management**: Grant/revoke specific contracts access to balance info
- [ ] **Threshold verification**: Yes/No answers for "balance >= X" queries  
- [ ] **Exact balance disclosure**: Full amount reveal to authorized contracts
- [ ] **Custom conditions**: Flexible disclosure rules (range checks, time-based)
- [ ] **Permission UI**: Manage active disclosures and expiration times
- [ ] **Audit trail**: Track which contracts accessed what information

### 4.5 Use Cases âœ…
- **Zelle-like transfers**: One-time authorization setup, instant transfers afterward
- **Privacy-preserving payments**: Transfer amounts encrypted until claimed
- **Family/friend networks**: Bidirectional authorization for trusted contacts  
- **Small business payments**: Authorized vendors can send payment requests
- **Allowance systems**: Parents authorize children with spending limits
- **Credit approval**: Banks can verify "balance >= $100" without seeing exact amount (FUTURE)
- **Loan qualification**: Lenders get threshold confirmation for risk assessment (FUTURE)
- **Account verification**: Services verify account exists without balance details (FUTURE)

### 4.3 Native Token (DUST) Support ðŸ†• (out of scope for now)
- [ ] **Contract Changes**:
  - Add `accepted_token` (Bytes<32>) in constructor or hardcode native token type.
  - Add `vault`: Map<Bytes<32>, CoinInfo> (or QualifiedCoinInfo) keyed by user_id.
  - Modify `deposit` circuit to accept a `CoinInfo` parameter and call `receive(coin)`.
  - Modify `withdraw` circuit to use `sendImmediate` and store the returned change.
  - Optional: Aggregate multiple deposits via `mergeCoin`/`mergeCoinImmediate`.
- [ ] **API/Wallet Changes**:
  - When calling deposit, pass a `CoinInfo` input. Wallet will select a user coin and attach it (or use `createZswapInput`).
  - On withdraw, no user input coin is needed; the contract spends from its vault.
  - Keep private balances as UX state, backed by real coins.

## ðŸš§ 5. Authorization UI Integration (Phase 4) - NEXT
- [ ] **Authorization Panel**: UI for requesting/approving transfer authorizations
- [ ] **Contact Management**: Add/manage authorized contacts with spending limits
- [ ] **Authorization Notifications**: Real-time updates for pending requests and approvals

- [ ] **Claim Interface**: Detect and claim pending encrypted transfers
- [ ] **Authorization History**: Track authorization requests, approvals, and transfers
- [ ] **Spending Limits**: Display and manage per-contact transfer limits
- [ ] **Bidirectional Setup**: Easy workflow for mutual authorizations

## ðŸš§ 6. Transaction History (Phase 5) - FUTURE
- [ ] Transaction history display from `transactionHistoryHex$` + `transactionCount`
- [ ] Client-side detailed history with filters and search
- [ ] Export functionality (CSV/JSON)
- [ ] Transaction details and timestamps

## âœ… 7. Technical Infrastructure - COMPLETED
