# Bank UI - Features & Implementation Status

**Current Status: Phase 2 COMPLETE âœ…**

This document tracks the implementation status of all Bank UI features.

## âœ… 1. Onboarding (Phase 1) - COMPLETED
- [x] Project scaffold (Vite + React + MUI)
- [x] Vite config for WASM/top-level-await/commonjs  
- [x] Dockerfile + Nginx runtime config
- [x] Onboarding page scaffold (deploy â†’ create â†’ verify)
- [x] Wallet/provider context (BankWalletProvider, connect button)
- [x] Local persistence via localStorage 
- [x] Create Account flow (deploy + create + verify)
- [x] **Session policy (10-min timeout) for balance authentication** âœ…

## âœ… 2. Accounts Home - COMPLETED
- [x] List saved accounts (local storage)
- [x] **Smart routing**: Shows create prompt when no accounts exist
- [x] **Account access tracking**: Updates lastUsedAt timestamps
- [ ] Add existing account by address (FUTURE)
- [ ] Rename/label accounts (FUTURE)

## âœ… 3. Account View (Phase 2) - COMPLETED  
- [x] **Masked balance**: Shows `***` by default for privacy âœ…
- [x] **Authenticate balance access**: PIN authentication with 10-min expiry âœ…
- [x] **Deposit/Withdraw actions**: PIN + amount input with real-time updates âœ…
- [x] **Verify account status**: PIN-based account verification âœ…
- [x] **Real-time state updates**: Direct RxJS subscription to `bankAPI.state$` âœ…
- [x] **Proper balance formatting**: Currency display (e.g., "50.00") âœ…
- [x] **Session timeout**: Auto-hide balance after 10 minutes âœ…
- [x] **Wallet connection status**: Visual indicators and warnings âœ…

## âœ… 4. Advanced Privacy Features (Phase 3.1) - COMPLETED ðŸ†•

### 4.1 Inter-Contract Transfers âœ…
- [x] **Send money to contract**: Transfer funds between Midnight Bank contracts
- [x] **Recipient validation**: Verify target contract is valid bank before transfer
- [x] **Private transfers**: Amount and recipient details remain confidential
- [x] **Transfer authorization**: PIN + amount confirmation with recipient address
- [ ] **Transfer history**: Private record of outgoing/incoming transfers
- [ ] **Real-time notifications**: Updates when transfers complete

### 4.2 Selective Balance Disclosure  
- [ ] **Permission management**: Grant/revoke specific contracts access to balance info
- [ ] **Threshold verification**: Yes/No answers for "balance >= X" queries  
- [ ] **Exact balance disclosure**: Full amount reveal to authorized contracts
- [ ] **Custom conditions**: Flexible disclosure rules (range checks, time-based)
- [ ] **Permission UI**: Manage active disclosures and expiration times
- [ ] **Audit trail**: Track which contracts accessed what information

### 4.3 Use Cases
- **Credit approval**: Banks can verify "balance >= $100" without seeing exact amount
- **Loan qualification**: Lenders get threshold confirmation for risk assessment  
- **Account verification**: Services verify account exists without balance details
- **P2P transfers**: Send funds to friends using their contract addresses
- **Merchant payments**: Pay businesses while keeping transaction details private

### 4.3 Native Token (DUST) Support ðŸ†•
- [ ] **Contract Changes**:
  - Add `accepted_token` (Bytes<32>) in constructor or hardcode native token type.
  - Add `vault`: Map<Bytes<32>, CoinInfo> (or QualifiedCoinInfo) keyed by user_id.
  - Modify `deposit` circuit to accept a `CoinInfo` parameter and call `receive(coin)`.
  - Modify `withdraw` circuit to use `sendImmediate` and store the returned change.
  - Optional: Aggregate multiple deposits via `mergeCoin`/`mergeCoinImmediate`.
- [ ] **API/Wallet Changes**:
  - When calling deposit, pass a `CoinInfo` input. Wallet will select a user coin and attach it (or use `createZswapInput`).
  - On withdraw, no user input coin is needed; the contract spends from its vault.
  - Keep private balances as UX state, backed by real coins.

## ðŸš§ 5. Transaction History (Phase 4) - FUTURE
- [ ] Transaction history display from `transactionHistoryHex$` + `transactionCount`
- [ ] Client-side detailed history with filters and search
- [ ] Export functionality (CSV/JSON)
- [ ] Transaction details and timestamps

## âœ… 6. Technical Infrastructure - COMPLETED
- [x] **Private state persistence**: Manual sync after circuit execution âœ…
- [x] **Contract address consistency**: Uses contract address as private state key âœ…
- [x] **RxJS state management**: Direct subscription to `bankAPI.state$` âœ…
- [x] **Session management**: 10-minute authentication timeout âœ…
- [x] **Error handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback âœ…

## âœ… 7. Wallet & Providers - COMPLETED
- [x] Provider construction (indexer, zk-config, proof, wallet, midnight) âœ…
- [x] **Lace wallet auto-connect**: Automatically connects if previously authorized âœ…
- [x] Public config ingestion (config.json) âœ…
- [x] **Network ID configuration**: Supports different Midnight networks âœ…
- [ ] Enhanced error notifications and user feedback (FUTURE)

## âœ… 8. Build & Dev Infrastructure - COMPLETED
- [x] Vite build with WASM support âœ…
- [x] SPA routing with history-api-fallback âœ…  
- [x] **Automatic bank keys copying**: ZK keys/circuits copied to dist âœ…
- [x] Development server optimization âœ…
- [x] **Turbo monorepo integration** âœ…
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (FUTURE)

## ðŸš§ 9. Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Backup/Restore**: Export encrypted private state + account data
- [ ] **Enhanced UX**: Better loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] **Account management**: Add existing accounts, rename/label functionality
- [ ] **Transaction history**: Full history view with filtering and export
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Code splitting and caching strategies

## âœ… 10. Documentation - UPDATED
- [x] **Implementation Plan (PLAN.md)**: Updated with current status âœ…
- [x] **Features tracking (FEATURES.md)**: This document âœ…
- [x] **Technical insights**: Private state management lessons documented âœ…
- [ ] User guide and deployment instructions (FUTURE)
