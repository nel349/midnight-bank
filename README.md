- **User-Centric Design**: Intuitive interface that doesn't compromise on privacy
- **Regulatory Ready**: Built-in compliance features for real-world deployment
- **Developer Friendly**: Clean, well-documented codebase for easy maintenance

### Modules

The repository contains the following modules:

1. **`bank-contract`**: Smart contract implementation for private banking operations
2. **`bank-api`**: API layer for interacting with bank contracts and the Midnight network
3. **`bank-ui`**: React-based user interface with privacy-focused design

### State Management

The application uses a sophisticated state management system:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Disconnected : Initialize
    Disconnected --> Connecting : Connect Wallet
    Connecting --> Connected : Wallet Connected
    Connected --> AccountSelection : Load Accounts
    AccountSelection --> BankingOperations : Select Account
    BankingOperations --> TransactionPending : Initiate Transaction
    TransactionPending --> BankingOperations : Transaction Complete
    BankingOperations --> AccountSelection : Switch Account
    Connected --> Disconnected : Disconnect Wallet
```

### Transaction Flow
